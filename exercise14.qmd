# Logistic modeling for response time over 3 days {.unnumbered}

The response time to 311 service requests is a measure of civic
service quality. Let us model the response time to 311 requests
with complain type `Rodent`.

1. Compute the response time in hours. Note that some response
   will be missing because of unavailable closed date.

2. Compute a binary variable `over3d`, which is one if the
   response time is greater than 3 days, and zero otherwise. Note
    that this variable should have no missing values.

3. Use the package `uszipcode` to obtain the zip code level
   covaraites such as median house income and median home value.
   Merge these variables to the rodent data.

4. Split the data at random into training (80%) and testing (20%).
   Build a logistic model to predict `over3d` on the training data,
   and validate the performance on the testing data.

5. Build a lasso logistic model to predict `over3d`, and justify
   your choice of the tuning parameter. Validate on the testing data.
